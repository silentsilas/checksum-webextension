## Standard Notes Checksum

This is a WebExtension that runs a checksum on the downloaded JS files for the Standard Notes web app.

## TODO

[x] Write proof-of-concept that displays the hash for the core Standard Notes JS file
[] Ensure it grabs the content of the latest files that were downloaded
[] Display hashes for all of Standard Notes JS files, including extensions
[] Brainstorm a way to automate hashing of latest webapp releases for this extension to validate against
